# Machine-Learning-Porject
This project aims to make a prediction about education. Therefore, the project contains different parts, which include cleaning, visualizing, or reshaping the data frame. Then, some of them are used in the machine learning part. Consequently, clicks to course materials were determined as an important indicator to predict who would fail or pass the course.
